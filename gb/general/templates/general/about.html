    <p>pyrogroupbuys.com was created as a free service to the pyro community to help streamline the group buy experience.  I saw an opportunity to take a fairly tedious process and improve it with some programming magic.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or ideas for new features, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:markmichon7@gmail.com">markmichon7@gmail.com</a>.  </p>

    <p>This app was entirely written in the Python programming language, using the Django web framework to put everything together.  The HTML is rendered with Django Template Language, and it utilizes a couple customized Bootstrap themes via Bootswatch.  The application calls out to a local PostgreSQL database which stores the application's state.  As of typing this, the apps currently uses ~5,200 lines of code.  Pyrogroupbuys is powered by Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS along with Apache Web Server and mod_wsgi.

    <p>If you have a good idea for your own web application and are looking for someone to make it, I'm your guy.  From scraping websites, to organizing large amounts of data, to triggering text/email alerts if something happens, theres really no limit as to what can be done.  I use very solid programming principles and frameworks to produce code centered around speed, security, and efficiency.</p>
