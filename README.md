**User Features**
+ **Your own private group buy events:**  The events you create are only viewable and accessible to you and people you invite.
+ **Fast and flexible group buy system:**  No more back and forth between participants and the organizer.  Want to
change your order?  Just log in and make the changes.  They will instantly change the order for the organizer.
+ **Built in explanations:**  Rather than having to go back and forth between documentations or asking questions, nearly
all pages have explanations built into them, guiding the users through the various functionality and flow of the 
application.  This can easily be toggled off or back on in the user's menu when authenticated.

+ **Streamlined case-split system:** Splitting a case with others just got a lot easier.  Pledge how many items in the 
case you'd like to order, and other users can make pledges as well.  Once all of the items in the case gets accounted
for, only then it gets locked into the order.

a customized list showing the cases and items you've ordered, its subtotal as well as the event total.  The event
